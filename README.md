1. Using the Pre-trained Model
This repository includes a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model located in the models/ directory.

File: models/road_detection_model.h5 
Usage: The live detection and image testing scripts load this file by default. You do not need to download a dataset to run the application.

2. Training Your Own Model
If you wish to retrain the model or improve its accuracy with fresh data, follow these steps:

A. Download the Dataset
Since the full dataset is not hosted in this repository to save space, you can download the required images from Kaggle:

Source: Search for "Pothole and Speed Breaker Dataset" on Kaggle.
Categories Needed: Ensure your dataset has images for Normal Road, Pothole, and Speed Breaker.
